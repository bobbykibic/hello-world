# hello-world

Hi I'm Bobby, I have a little bit of programming experience in dbaseiii back in mid 80s. I saw the freecodecamp video 
in youtube and I told myself why not give it a try. I wanted to learn new technologies like html, css, javascript, bootstrap,
jquery, react, angular, php, mysql, python, java etc. I don't have a college degree but my goal is to be good in all of these
and be a backend programmer.
